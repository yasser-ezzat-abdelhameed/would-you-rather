# Would You Rather Project

Would You Rather app alows you browser, create and answer polls.
This is the second project in the [React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

## How it works
- First you should sign in if you have an existing account, or create a new account then sign in.
- Next, you are going to be able to browse polls, you can switch between unanswered and answered polls.
- Every poll is viewable, if you wish to vote for a poll, you can do so by clicking on view poll and select an answer and submit it.
- Answered polls have the number of votes and percentage of each answer displayed.
- You can also create a new poll with any two options you wish to add.
- The leader board shows the users with the highest score, the score is determined by the sum of questions answered plus the questions added by a user, make sure you add and answer as many polls as possible to top this list ;)
